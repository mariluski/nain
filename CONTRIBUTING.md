# Nain contributing guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Nain! This document outlines the process for contributing to Nain, including how to report bugs, submit feature requests, and submit pull requests.

## If its your first time contributing to an open source project

Welcome to the community! We're excited to have you onboard.
You can contribute in many ways, such as:

- Reporting bugs
- Suggesting new features
- Fixing bugs
- Adding documentation
- Submitting pull requests
- Translating Nain to other languages

### How to submit a pull request

A pull request is a request to merge your changes into the open source project yoy are contributing. To submit a pull request, follow these steps:

1. Fork the GitHub repository of the project you want to contribute to.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine. (You can also do it on the online GitHub interface, but it isn't recommended.)
3. Click the "Contribute" button on the project's GitHub page.
   **We also encourage you to read the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) on how to contribute to open source projects and learn a little bit of Git and GitHub.**
4. Add a title and description to your pull request.
   We recomend using the following format for the title: What you did: What you changed.
   And a more detailed description of the changes you made on the description field.

## Reporting bugs

If you find a bug, please report it by creating an issue on the [Nain repository](https://github.com/mariluski/nain/issues).

## What you can't do

1. Don't remove the license, contributing guidelines, or code of conduct.
2. Follow the code of conduct also when contributing.
3. If you are searching for bugs and find one, report it as a bug, not a feature request, vulnerability, or question.
4. Don't spam the repository with pull requests.
   If you want to contribute, please only put the PR once, not 300 times, we are going to reject it.

Thank you for your contribution!
